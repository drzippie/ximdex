The webdav server used in test.php is freely available to the public.
User: demo@xwave.ch
Pass: demodemo
Server: http://demo.webdav.ch/

You can localy modify test.php as you like and run it against demo.webdav.ch or of course you own webdav server.

Look at our fine X-DAV DHTML client. 
It's an Interface to Xwave's Webdav Service (http://x-dav.xwave.ch/),
where this class is in use.

Have fun.
