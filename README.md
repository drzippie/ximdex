This bash script will automatically download the last release, ask you some parameters to configure it and install Ximdex. 


* Description
  -----------

  In fact, it is a powerful and versatile Content Management Framework (CMF) to help you manage information in form of data, content or services to be published in the cloud as web portals, structured semantic repositories or open datasets. 

  With Ximdex CMS you can mix structured and non-structured content and data, represent apps and services, aggretate from remote sources, capture metadata, automatically generate suggestions for your content (as images, new links or references, ...)

  Ximdex is modular, based on standards (XML, XSLT, RDF, ...) and it adds a semantic layer to any managed element (doc, app, picture, metadata, video, etc.) that makes it easy to adapt information to any final exploitation format (html5, rdf, j2ee, php, json, RoR, xml/xslt, â€¦)

* Features

  - Flexible, Secure, Scalable
  - Neutral: content independence, format agnostic, free structure, open access, ...

  - Visual Role/User/Workflow edition in an object-action UI
  - Its neutrality and flexibility allows to use any application server or language for the deployment of portals and web applications: .NET, PHP, ASP, J2EE, XML/XSLT, flash, XHTML, HTML5, ...
